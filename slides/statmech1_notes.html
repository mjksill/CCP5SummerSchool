And so this is the kind of system mechanics is going to be one of the
cornerstones of what you're going to learn in this module. So this
kind of interesting question is, you know, so that you know that
there's like 10 to the 23 you know in in a gram of water, around 10 or
20, three kind of molecules of water. And if you think about all the
different numbers, you have to specify to get the positions and
velocities of every single particle. Every single water molecule in
the system. You just think that you know there's too much
information. How do you know that you have the same sort of bunch of
water than someone else, right? But what's kind of interesting is that
if you think of water from thermodynamics, how many different
parameters you need to specify in order to kind of make sure that you
have the same water in the same state as someone else. And the answer
is like 2 right? You need to know like temperature and pressure or
temperature and density.
</p>

<p>
So how did you actually reduce something that actually is is 10 to the
23 degrees of freedom.  Down to something with just two degrees of
freedom.
</p>

<p>
Alright, and what's sort of interesting is that that's kind of related
to, well, this. This sort of how everything kind of reduces to
Gaussian Statistics.
</p>

<p>
It's also kind of interesting in terms of like when you get huge
numbers of multiple when you have huge numbers of events.  Actually,
things are much more predictable than if you just have single events,
right? So that's why sort of when you're gambling in a casino.  You
know whether you win or lose in a particular day or whatever, is
actually very difficult to kind of predict, right?
</p>

<p>
But the casino always wins 'cause they know very precisely. Given that
you know 1000 people gamble everyday or 10,000 people gamble or
there's 10,000 kind of games going on. They can tell you pretty
precisely how many people are gonna win and how many people going to
lose and what the distribution of that's going to be.
</p>

<p>
And so even though the individual events may be very difficult to. To
determine The actual statistics of them are actually quite
reproducible, and you can actually do a lot to kind of model
that. Yep, next slide, thanks.

  Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics. Perhaps it will be wise to approach the subject cautiously.

The first law of thermodynamics guarantees that energy is conserved.
</p>

<p>
Energy can take on many different forms, and these forms can be
converted to one another; however, energy can neither be created or
destroyed.
</p>

<p>
So the statement that we need to because about energy use does not
really make sense.  However, we know that there is something to that
statement that rings true.  We do not live in a world with
inexhaustible resources.

So the question is what is the real problem?

The second law of thermodynamics is interesting in that it is one of
the few laws of physics that is not reversible.  Most physical
dynamical equations, such as Newton's laws of motion or even the
Schrodinger equation, are the same moving forward and backward in
time.  This is not the case for the second law of thermodynamics,
which does show a difference.

From the fundamental equation of thermodynamics, we can deduce
relations between the various properties of the system.  To see this,
let's consider a function \(f\) with independent variables \(x\) and \(y\).
The differential of \(f\) (i.e.\ the total change in \(f\)) can be written
as given here.
</p>

<p>
The first term represents the change in \(f\) due to changes in the
independent variable \(x\), and the second term representce changes due
to the independent variable \(y\).  Note that this equation is just a
generalization of a first order Taylor series expansion to a function
of three variables.
