    "In many problems that we will encounter, we will need to find the solution to an algebraic equation or a set of algebraic equations.  While certain situations, these equations can be solved analytically, often this is not possible.  In this case, numerical methods need to be used.  In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Python to solve algebraic equations.  Note that these equations can be non-linear, and as a result, there is the possibility that they can can no solutions or multiple solutions."
