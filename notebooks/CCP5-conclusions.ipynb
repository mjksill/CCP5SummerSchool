While this is an excellent way to explore python, you will often want to run your own python programs without a GUI (say on a High Performance Computer) or make a python \"program\". To that end I recommend that you get a local install of python on your own laptop so you can experiment with programming offline.\n","\n","## VSCode on Windows/Linux\n","\n","An excellent environment is VSCode, primarily because it has a debug mode for python, where you can go step-by-step through python code and see what the computer is doing.

Make sure to select the Python 3 version as python 2.7 is quite old now. Juypyter notebook comes as standard with the anaconda program as well as several excellent editors. You can install pretty much any package you need via pip and the anaconda console.\n","\n","## Linux (Ubuntu)\n","\n","If you're using linux already, I'm going to assume you already have a favourite text editor you want to use for python development, then you only need python packages.
