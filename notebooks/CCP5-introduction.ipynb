    "This is no different, it is the nature of the problem. Learning programming is exactly like playing music, the good and the bad.\n",
    "As you start to learn music/code, your music/code will not work at first, then it will sound/run terrible, but you must practice and learn to \"fail upwards\" by learning what \"sounds\"/runs nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A massive aspect is learning how you fail, coding is 1/3rds programming, then 2/3rds finding the errors/unconsidered-complications. Good programmers still make many mistakes, they just write code so the mistakes are obvious and easy to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually you will become a maestro with practice, and will be able to improv code that makes your non-programmer friends stare in amazement. Fair warning though, music might help you make more friends, but programming will make computers do your work for you so you have more time for the finer aspects of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot hope to teach you everything about programming in two-days, so I hope to show you a quick overview, teach you very carefully the hardest part of python (the reference/side-affects/spooky action at a distance).  Finally, we will talk about examples, as you will probably eventually learn programming from Googling your problem, using a LLM, like Gemini or ChatGPT, and reading other people's code.\n",
