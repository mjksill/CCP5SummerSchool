This notebook will cover some of the basic commands in Pandas.\n",

Download the file \"functions.csv\" by clicking [here](https://mjksill.github.io/CCP5SummerSchool/data/functions.csv).  This should put a copy of the file in the directory where files are generally downloaded (e.g., in the directory ~/Downloads/).\n",
